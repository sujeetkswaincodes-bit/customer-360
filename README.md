and understand the drivers for churners and high spenders. Along with that, the company wants 
to understand overall customer behavior so that they can define the strategy to improve the

What do you require to work? 
To achieve the solution, 
1. The team would like you to work on the “Customer360 data set” using instructions 
(description) provided in “Customer360 Instruction.xlsx”. As part of this file, every record 
will be at the customer level (aggregating the information at the customer level). 
2. Once we created the Customer 360 data set created from step 1, you are required to 
perform the below analysis 
• Identify key drivers of churners (You can build a classification model using 
Churn_flag as a dependent variable)
